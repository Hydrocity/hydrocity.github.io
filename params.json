This website gives information about the current staff, and  includes the rules, shop, and weekly events that take place in the room. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Current News\r\n\r\n**08-08-2016** : This website was made by one of Hydrocity's staff members, Mighty Sciz. Currently, we are trying to do our very best to make Hydrocity a private room. However, the [Supernova Server](http://supernova.psim.us) is the temporarily hangout for people of Hydrocity in case if the groupchat dies due to inactivity or server restarts.\r\n\r\n",
